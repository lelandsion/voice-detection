> Note: Keep all tasks unassigned by default in GitHub. The names below are **suggested owners** (role holders). Only the Project itself should be assigned to the requester and Leland.

## GitHub Project (1 board)
- **Name:** Voice Verification With Noise (Live Demo)
- **Owners:** Requester + Leland
- **Scope:** Single-user enrollment and yes/no verification under music/environmental noise; GPU allowed for training/embedding extraction; must ship live mic demo (enroll → verify with random prompts, VAD, embedding, score, decision).
- **Definition of Done (overall):**
  - Reproducible pipeline (scripts + configs)
  - ISMIR-style report (15–20 references)
  - Live Windows laptop mic demo with clear accept/reject behavior

## Milestones (deliverables)
- **M1 — Design/Requirements Spec** — Target: **Feb 5, 2026**  
  Deliverable: PDF + sources (Overleaf or paper/).  
  Acceptance: describe project overview (abstract), tools/datasets (provisional ok), timeline w/ objectives (Gantt Chart) + roles, related work (has someone done something similar and what can we learn from them), 15–20 refs (datasets, tools etc.), 2-4 pages long in ISMIR template.
