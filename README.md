# music-singer-recognition

Detect whether recorded audio is human or AI-generated and, for human vocals, recognize the artist/singer.

## Project Focus
- Build a centralized classification pipeline for audio deepfake detection and singer identification.
- Target use case: flag synthetic vocals and attribute genuine recordings to known artists.
- Skills welcomed: audio feature engineering, deep learning for audio, Python-based data science.
